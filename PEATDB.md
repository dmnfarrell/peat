<h1>Introduction</h1>

<b>Protein Engineering Analysis Tool (Database)</b> (PEATDB) is a desktop application built for sharing, analysing and storing experimental and theoretical data from Protein Engineering experiments. This software is released as free software under the terms of the GPLv3.<br>
<br>
PEATDB is a workbench for protein studies that provides some of the functions of a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) integrated with analysis tools. Included are algorithms for fitting experimental data on the biophysical characteristics of proteins. PEATDB also contains funtions for handling and analysing protein structures, and therefore allows the interpretation of experimental data in a structural context.<br>
