DataPipeline is a python desktop and web application that uses the fitting and
plotting libraries from PEAT to automate the import of raw data in a variety
of formats. It is also used for transforming the imported data through various
stages of fitting to achieve a final measured parameter. 
This is useful for handling large amounts of data (e.g from csv files) in a
consistent way without having to store everything in spreadsheets.
