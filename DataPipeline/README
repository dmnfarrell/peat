DataPipeline is a python desktop and command line application that uses the fitting
 and plotting libraries from PEAT to automate the import of raw data in a variety of formats. 
It is also used for transforming the imported data through various stages of fitting to
 achieve a final measured parameter. This is useful for handling large amounts of data 
(e.g from csv files) in a consistent way without having to store everything in spreadsheets.
