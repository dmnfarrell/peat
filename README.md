PEAT is a suite of programs for capturing, analyzing and predicting biophysical characteristics of proteins

PEATDB (Protein Engineering Analysis Tool - Database) is an application for sharing, analysing and 
storing experimental and theoretical data from Protein Engineering experiments.

PEATSA allows you to analyse the effect of each amino acid residue on the biophysical characteristics of
a protein. Currently PEAT_SA computes changes in, pKa values, Protein stability and Protein-ligand binding
affinity for a given set of point mutations.

DataPipeline is a standalone application for data handling that uses some of the peat libraries. 
It can be downloaded from the downloads section. Also see DataPipelineInstallation for more details.

pKaTool is a sub-component of PEAT, which can be used to analyze the results of protein pKa calculations.

This program is no longer actively maintained.
