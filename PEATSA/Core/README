Configuration File

A number options can be set through the programs configuration file - proteinDesignTool.conf.
If none is specified (using the  --configurationFile option) then one is searched for in the directory the
program is being run from and then the users home directory.
If no configuration file exists in either location one is created in the directory the program is run from.
Due to the different programs this tool uses it is usually necessary to set a number of paths in this
file in order to run it with any hope of success.
