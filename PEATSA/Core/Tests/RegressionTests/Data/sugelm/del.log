 |                                                | 
 | A program to solve the PB equation             | 
 | in 3D, using non-linear form, incorporating    | 
 | many dielectric regions, multisalt ionic       | 
 | strength, different probe radii, periodic      | 
 | and focussing boundary conditions, utilizing   | 
 | stripped optimum successive over-relaxation    | 
 | and an improved algorithm for mapping the      | 
 | Mol. Surface to the finite-Difference grid     | 
 | Recompiled on Linux and PC                     |
