Contains PHP code for accessing and displaying PEAT_SA job data through the web.
Each job data is stored in a PEAT-SA MySQL database and is accessed using the jobs unique identification.

To access these files using include(), the containing PEATSA directory must be in php include path.
One way to do this is to create a link to the PEATSA dir in /usr/share/php/


Note: This code does not provide a full interface on its own


*** Modules ***

The provided php modules can be broken into two types. 
The first provide functionality related to accessing data. 
The second for displaying that data ("views").
In addition some of the php modules provide functions for use in creating php scripts while others are complete
php scripts themselves.

* Data Access 

DataRetrieval.php
	- Provides core php functions for retrieving job data from a PEAT-SA database	

Session.php
	- Provides functions for setting which database the retreival functions will use by default
	- These functions can also be used to set a default database for an entire website or for specific users etc.
	
Utilities.php
	- Functions useful for working with PEAT-SA data - includes functions for querying a jobs state.	

DownloadMatrix.php
	-  A complete php script for downloading PEAT-SA data. 	

* Data Display

MatrixViewer.php 
	- Use to display a PEAT-SA csv data on a webpage
	
JobBrowser.php 	
	- Use to display information on the jobs in a database on a webpage

StructureViewer.php
	- Use to display the structure associated with a PEATSA job on a webapge
	

*** Sessions ***

Information on the database to access can be provided directly to retrieval functions OR be stored in a session specific variable.
The second option allows applications using these modules to set the database to access per-user/per-server and automatically
have all retrieval functions use it.

To set the database in this way you use 

start_peatsa_database_session($DOMAIN);
set_peatsa_database_session_configuration_file($FILE)

The first call creates a session for $DOMAIN.
$DOMAIN specifies the pages on your server that the session will apply to.

For example if the pages of your website lie under http://myserver.com/PEAT_SA/ then setting $DOMAIN to PEAT_SA
will create a session for each user that applies every time they visit a page under PEAT_SA.

$FILE is the location of a correctly formatted PEAT-SA configuration file containing the database parameters.


On errors many function return an error array.
The array entries are
	jobID (optional)
	domain
	description
	detailedDescription
	recoverySuggestion
