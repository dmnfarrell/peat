# PEAT #
PEAT is a suite of programs for capturing, analyzing and predicting biophysical characteristics of proteins.

**[PEATDB](PEATDB.md)** (Protein Engineering Analysis Tool - Database) is an application for sharing, analysing and storing experimental and theoretical data from Protein Engineering experiments.

**[PEATSA](PEATSA.md)** allows you to analyse the effect of each amino acid residue on the biophysical characteristics of a protein. Currently PEAT\_SA computes changes in, pKa values, Protein stability and Protein-ligand binding affinity for a given set of point mutations.

# DataPipeline #
Is a standalone application for data handling that uses some of the peat libraries. It can  be downloaded from the downloads section. Also see DataPipelineInstallation for more details.

# pKaTool #
pKaTool is a sub-component of PEAT, which can be used to analyze the results of protein pKa calculations.
