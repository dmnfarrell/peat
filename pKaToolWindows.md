## pKaTool Windows problems ##

The pKaTool installer package seems to have problems on Windows 7. If this is the case then try the following approach:

  1. Download pKaTool.zip above
  1. Unpack the zip file into C:\Python2.6\Lib\site-packages (this path might be slightly different on your computer)
  1. Add a shortcut to C:\Python2.6\Lib\site-packages\pKaTool\pKarun\_main.py to your Desktop
  1. double-click the shortcut and you should be good to go.
