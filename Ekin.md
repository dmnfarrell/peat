<b>Ekin</b>is an application for storage, plotting and non-linear fitting of 2 dimensional x-y data. Ekin can be run as a stand-alone program or as a module from within PEATDB or DataPipeline. Ekin lets you import or manually enter experimental data and fit them to standard equations used in biochemistry/biophysics.<br>
<br>
<h1>Overview</h1>

Experimental data can be entered directly into Ekin by typing data in the upper left-hand table, and can also be imported in various formats in the Data pulldown menu.<br>
<br>
The lower left side of the Ekin window holds information on the current Ekin data model and the associated [<a href='Fit.md'>parameters</a>], which can be changed by clicking the model selector button. The fit models that are available are controlled by the Ekin mode.<br>

<h1>Availability</h1>

Ekin is distributed as part of the PEATDB and DataPipeline applications. If you have installed either of these in windows a shortcut to Ekin will be placed in the start menu. If you have used easy_install to install them, the command 'ekin' will open the program from the command line.
