*** PREPERATION ***

1. Ensure no "zope" module is present in standard system locations.
	These are under one/all of
	- /LibraryFrameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/
	- /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/
	- /Library/Python/2.5/

	/Library/Frameworks is the Leopard (or possibly Tiger) location, /System/Library/Frameworks is the SnowLeopard location.
	If you've been upgrading OS's you may have both.

	The existance of necessary zope sub-modules under 'zope' in one of these locations will cause that module not be fetched when getting ZODB/relstorage.
	py2app then can't handle the multiple 'zope' modules being in different locations and leaves out the system one.
	As an aside import can't handle this either so even if you have the missing module in a system location the app still fails (The reasons are too complicated to explain here).

2. Install MySQL 5.14 32bit
	N.B. Make sure its the 32 bit version.
	Using a 64 bit version will lead to incompatiblities when used with python 2.5 (32 bit) - the 32 bit MySQLdb module won't be able to link the mysqlclient libraries.

	Its assumed that the installation will be under /usr/local/mysql/ - changing this will mean mysql_config cannot be found and MySQLdb will fail to build.


*** GET PACKAGES ***

To ensure the package creation works you should build all required packages from scratch in ExternalPackages.
This prevents any problems with py2app incorporating wrong/incompatible modules etc. etc. which may arise using already installed packages.
N.B. ALL packages must be built for python2.5.
python 2.6 is 64 bit on SnowLeopard and as a result doesn't work properly with py2app.
NOTE: Its possible that you could build using 2.6 if you installed it 32 bit on Leopard.

1. Use GetPackages.sh 
	This will retrieve zope and MySQLdb packages

2. Manually build matplotlib (version 0.99 required)
	easy_install retrieves version 0.91 which is incompatible.
	You can get the correct version at http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/matplotlib/matplotlib-0.99.3/matplotlib-0.99.3.tar.gz/download
	Note you NEED the source package (not an auto installer package)!

	Once you have it run

	python2.5 setup.py install --install-lib=$PACKAGEDIR/ExternalPackages 

3. Manually build numpy
	It is usually OK to use an installed version of this ...
	You must manually build it because using easy_install it fails (SnowLeopard)

4. Pmw
	Make sure to use pmw-static - add the 3 py files to ExternalPackage (i.e. NOT in a directory)

*** BUILD PACKAGE ***

Run 

BuildPackage.sh $PEATSOURCEDIRECTORY $VERSIONNUMBER 

e.g

./BuildPackage.sh $HOME/PEAT 1.0

VERSIONNUMBER can be omitted.
